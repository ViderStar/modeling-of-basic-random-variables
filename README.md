# modeling-of-basic-random-variables

This repository contains code for two lab works related to random number generators and probability distributions.

## LabRabota1

The `LabRabota1` function demonstrates the usage of two random number generators: MKM (Mixed Congruential Method) and MacLaren-Marsaglia. It generates a sequence of random numbers using these generators and prints the first, 14th, and 1000th elements of each sequence.

## LabRabota2

The `LabRabota2` function focuses on probability distributions, specifically the Bernoulli and binomial distributions. It generates random numbers following these distributions and performs the following tasks:

- Plots the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) for the Bernoulli distribution.
- Calculates the unbiased mean and variance for both the Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric and Poisson distributions.
- Compares the calculated values with the true mean and variance of the distributions.

## Usage

To run the code, make sure you have the required packages installed. You can run the code by executing the following command:

```python main.py```

Make sure to modify the parameters in the code as needed for your specific experiments.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```pip install numpy matplotlib```
